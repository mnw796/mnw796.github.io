<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, planning on majoring in marketing with a minor in Sports Management. I was born in Dallas, Texas but I grew up in DeSoto, a small suburb 15 miles outside of Dallas. I'm grateful of my experience of living there because I met amazing life-long friends who helped shaped me into the person I am today. <3 <br /><br /></p>

<p>I love spending time with my friends and playing video games! I am an avid gamer girl who just loves to play video games! Through playing video games, I've met amazing people all over the world, in which, I'm sure I wouldn't have met otherwise. My favorite food is baked ziti and I LOVE coffee. My day hasn't started unless I've had my coffee! ;) </p>
